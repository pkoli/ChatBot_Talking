ChatBot_Talking
===============
PARI stands for Python ARtifical Intelligence.
This is a bot that uses aiml along with pyttsx to enable the bot to talk to us. The speech is converted to text which is then supplied to the bot to generate a response. The response depends on the Omegle.brn file. Change the .brn file and you'll get different response. Finally the text is converted to speech using text to speech converter.
